## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to predict measurements" Error

This error can occur due to several reasons:

#### 1. **Input Validation Issues**
- **Solution**: Ensure height is between 120-250 cm
- **Solution**: Ensure weight is between 30-300 kg
- **Solution**: Check that both fields are filled

#### 2. **Authentication Issues**
- **Cause**: Session timeout or login required
- **Solution**: Refresh page and re-login with credentials:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `tryon2024`

#### 3. **Network/Connection Issues**
- **Cause**: Docker container not running or network problems
- **Solution**: Check if the application is accessible
- **Solution**: Try refreshing the page
- **Solution**: Check browser console for detailed error messages

#### 4. **Server-Side Issues**
- **Cause**: Python dependencies missing or server error
- **Solution**: Check server logs in Docker container
- **Solution**: Restart the Docker container

### Debug Steps

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Click "Predict Sizes"**
4. **Check console messages** for detailed error information:
   - Look for messages starting with 🔍, 📐, 📡, 📊, ✅, or ❌
   - Note any error messages or failed network requests

5. **Common Console Messages**:
   ```
   🔍 Starting measurement prediction...
   📐 Input values: height=175, weight=70, gender=male
   📡 Preparing form data...
   🚀 Sending request to /predict-measurements
   📊 Response status: 200
   ✅ Prediction successful, displaying results
   ```

6. **If you see network errors**:
   - Check if the URL `https://virtual-try-on.wearneko.com/predict-measurements` is accessible

### Anthropometric Formulas Used

The predictions are based on established anthropometric research:

- **Male Ratios**: Based on average male body proportions
- **Female Ratios**: Based on average female body proportions  
- **BMI Adjustment**: Measurements scaled based on body composition
- **Size Charts**: Industry-standard clothing size conversions

### Accuracy Notes

- **Measurements**: ±5-10% accuracy typical for height/weight-based predictions
- **Sizes**: Recommendations may vary by brand and fit preference
- **Individual Variation**: Actual measurements may differ due to body type, muscle mass, etc.
- **Best Use**: As starting point for size selection, not definitive measurements

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check Server Status**: Verify the Docker container is running
2. **Review Logs**: Check Docker container logs for Python errors
3. **Test Basic Functionality**: Try the virtual try-on feature to ensure core app works
4. **Browser Issues**: Try different browser or incognito mode
5. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies

### Manual Testing

You can test the body measurements module directly:

```bash
# In the Docker container or local environment
python3 test_measurements.py
```

This will verify the core prediction functionality works correctly.
